# BST232_Kaggle

## Repo for BST232 group project / Kaggle challenge

## Directories

**data** contains the the training and test datasets for the projects

**models** includes any R code of models that have been run

**results** is a directory where you can save your model predictions

## "Rules"

For now, feel free to create a new file for every new analysis you're running. For example, say you are using Lasso or ridge regression, you could name the new file ridge_<your name>. This may not be the ideal approach, but probably the most feasible given our time constraints. 

We only get two submissions per day, so **contact the team** if you're planning on submitting something to Kaggle.
